Well, this is a fair question. In user-friendly distribution (Ubuntu, LinuxMint, Fedora) the usage of the terminal is getting occasional and less common for a normal user. However from times to times you're still find yourself struggling with some configuration file or some local content you're not allowed to see (file permission).

```sh
myUser@myHostName:~$ gedit
```
